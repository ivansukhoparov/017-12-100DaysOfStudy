- Create html markdown for login form, add new task form and task-window

I wanted today learn promises or websokets deeply. Because I need it for some of my pet projects. 
But actually I made html markup for my another pet project that I didn't think I really back for.
I don't like html or css very strong, and I hope I will find someone who like it and will do some of 
my project with me.

So, I refresh my knowledge in this area as it possible. And I don't sure I made it right.
